# Pomodoro Timer
This is a Pomodoro Technique timer that can help you manage your time by implementing 25 minutes work periods and 5 minutes short rest periods, with a longer 25 minutes rest every 4 cycles.
## Features
- 25 minutes work timer
- 5 minutes short rest timer
- 25 minutes long rest every 4 cycles
- Automatically switches between work timer, short rest and long rest
- Customizable work, short rest and long rest durations
## Usage
1. Install the dependencies:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. Run the timer:
```
 python timer.py
```
3. When the work timer is on, do your work. When the short rest timer is on, take a short break. When the long rest timer is on every 4 cycles, take a longer rest.
4. The timer will automatically switch between states, and prompt you when it's time to work/rest.
## Customization
You can customize the work minutes, short rest minutes and long rest minutes by changing the work_minutes, break_minutes and long_break_minutes variables in the Timer() initialization.
